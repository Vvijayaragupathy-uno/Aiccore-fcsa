BALANCE SHEET: ${balanceFile.name}
${balanceData.substring(0, 2000)}...

CRITICAL: Your response must include specific dollar amounts and percentages for financial charts and trend analysis. Extract actual numbers from the data where possible.

IMPORTANT: This is a COMBINED analysis focusing on:
1. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE)
2. Efficiency ratios (Asset Turnover)
3. Debt service coverage ratio and how income supports debt obligations
4. Cash flow adequacy relative to capital structure
5. Integrated financial health indicators that combine earnings and capital metrics
6. How earnings trends impact balance sheet strength
7. Sustainability of the business model and capital structure
