# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the combined financial analysis component where follow-up questions are not being generated by ChatGPT, empty or invalid sections are still being displayed, and incorrect debt coverage calculations are shown. The goal is to improve the user experience by hiding invalid content and ensuring proper ChatGPT integration for follow-up questions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want follow-up questions to be automatically generated by ChatGPT after analysis completion, so that I can quickly explore deeper insights without having to think of questions myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a combined financial analysis is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate 3-5 relevant follow-up questions using ChatGPT
2. WHEN follow-up questions are generated THEN they SHALL be displayed in a dedicated section below the analysis results
3. WHEN a user clicks on a suggested question THEN it SHALL automatically populate the follow-up question input field
4. WHEN follow-up questions fail to generate THEN the system SHALL gracefully hide the suggestions section
5. WHEN follow-up questions are generated THEN they SHALL be contextually relevant to the specific analysis results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want sections with no valid data or incorrect calculations to be hidden from view, so that I only see meaningful and accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a financial metric has invalid data (null, undefined, NaN, or 0) THEN the corresponding section SHALL be hidden
2. WHEN debt coverage calculation is incorrect or invalid THEN the debt coverage section SHALL be hidden
3. WHEN a chart has no valid data points THEN the chart SHALL be hidden and not display empty space
4. WHEN all metrics in a section are invalid THEN the entire section SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN sections are hidden THEN the layout SHALL adjust automatically without leaving empty spaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want debt coverage calculations to be accurate and based on proper financial formulas, so that I can make reliable credit decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating debt coverage ratio THEN the system SHALL use the formula: (Net Income + Depreciation + Interest) / (Principal + Interest Payments)
2. WHEN debt service information is not available THEN the debt coverage section SHALL be hidden
3. WHEN debt coverage ratio is calculated THEN it SHALL be validated against standard lending benchmarks
4. WHEN debt coverage data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL not display misleading placeholder values
5. WHEN debt coverage is displayed THEN it SHALL include proper context about the calculation method used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be clean and only show relevant information, so that I can focus on meaningful financial insights without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections have no content THEN they SHALL be completely removed from the DOM
2. WHEN charts have insufficient data THEN they SHALL display a "No data available" message or be hidden
3. WHEN the Risk Assessment Matrix has no valid risk factors THEN it SHALL be hidden
4. WHEN financial trends cannot be calculated THEN trend indicators SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN the layout adjusts for hidden sections THEN it SHALL maintain proper spacing and visual hierarchy
